   <h3> If you were a boat, what type would you be?</h3>
    <p> If I am a boat I would be a Sailboat. This type of boat uses wind power to move which is unique nowadays as most of the boats being used utilizes engine to be powered. 
        Also, sailboats may be small but they can travel long distances as long as there is a wind. I can compare myself to this type, as I am a person who goes out of the box, and want something different each time. 
        I tend to be unique and different from other people like the sailboat being different to other types of boats. </p>
