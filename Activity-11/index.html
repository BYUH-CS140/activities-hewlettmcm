      <h2>Exploring Seoul’s Hidden Gems</h2>
      <p>
        My trip to Korea was more than just sightseeing, it was a dive into a culture rich with history, flavors, and stories. Wandering the vibrant streets of Seoul, I stumbled upon tucked-away cafés, street markets bursting with color, and locals who made me feel right at home. 
        From early morning strolls in Bukchon Hanok Village to late-night bites in Myeongdong, every corner held a surprise.

      <h2>Moments at Gyeongbokgung Palace</h2>
      <p>
        Standing before the grand gates of Gyeongbokgung Palace, I felt transported back in time. The changing of the guard ceremony, with its vibrant costumes and rhythmic drums, brought the Joseon dynasty to life. 
        I spent hours walking through the tranquil palace grounds, camera in hand, capturing the harmony between traditional architecture and modern Seoul skyline.

      Visiting the palace was a highlight of my Korean adventure. As I stood in front of the ornate rooftops and centuries-old stone paths, I couldn’t help but feel a deep appreciation for the stories embedded in every tile and beam. The photo here was taken just before sunset, with golden light casting a magical glow over everything.
