        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Hewlett, a passionate visual storyteller with a love for travel, culture, and capturing moments that often go unseen. 
            My journey through South Korea was a deeply personal and creative experience, every frame you see on the gallery page of this site was taken with my Sony A7C II and a Sigma Art 85mm f/1.4 lens. 
            From vibrant street life to serene historical sites, I aimed to preserve both the beauty and emotion of each scene. This website is my way of sharing that journey with you, one photo at a time.
            If you're interested, you can see more of my photoshoots here on this link "hewlettmcm1c2c.myportfolio.com".</p>
