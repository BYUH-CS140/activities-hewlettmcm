        <p> These photos are more than snapshots, theyâ€™re pieces of my journey through South Korea. From the golden light hitting palace walls to locals dressed in vibrant hanbok, each moment felt like a perfect story waiting to be captured. 
            I took all these photos with my Sony A7C II, using it not just as a camera, but as a companion through every temple, alleyway, and cultural exchange. 
            I hope these images bring you as close to the experience as I felt behind the lens.</p>
