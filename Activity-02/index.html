<p> <strong>“Aloha: Life of an International Student at BYU Hawaii” </strong></p>
<p> <em>Another beautiful day in paradise.</em> I’m Hewlett Madriaga, and I’m from the Philippines. I never imagined I’d be living and studying at BYU–Hawaii!</p>
<p> <mark>BYU–Hawaii isn’t just a school—it’s a multicultural hub.</mark> <q> We have students from over 70 countries. Every day feels like the world is just next door.</q></p>
<p> Most students work part-time. I work at the Polynesian Cultural Center as a content creator for the Marketing Department. It’s more than just a job; it’s a way to share culture and earn my way through school.</p>
<p> Being far from home is hard, but my <b>ohana</b> here makes me feel like I’m never alone.</p>
<p> Life as an international student at BYU–Hawaii is full of learning, growing, and aloha. I’m not just getting a degree but also I’m building a global family. </p>

<p> <b>My Hobbies are:</b></p>
<p>One of my favorite hobbies is photography—sunrises here are insane. When I’m not in class, I’m out filming, editing, or chasing that perfect light.</p>
<p>I work part-time at the Polynesian Cultural Center. Sometimes I’m on tech crew, filming shows or making highlight reels. It’s a job, but also a creative playground."</p></section>
